# Virtual GeoVisLab in Second Life

## General Information
### Project Idea
- The basic idea has been to set up a virtual pendant of the [Geovisualization Lab]
  (https://www.hochschule-bochum.de/fbg/einrichtungen-im-fachbereich/labor-fuer-geovisualisierung-geovis/)
  (GeoVisLab) in Second Life (SL). 
- The virtual lab can be found here: [Chicory Field(68,85,26)](http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Chicory%20Field/68/85/26)

### Source Code Artifacts
- What you will find in this repository, is the parameterization of the self-created 
  objects inside our SL lab (furnishings, exhibits, etc.). Moreover, reference 
  information for the objects purchased via the Second Life Marketplace has been 
  documented.
- Particularly, the source code of all programmed scripts can be found in this 
  repository. The programming has been done using the LSL ("Linden Scripting Language").
- In the end, interfaces to Web-services which are accessed via HTTP from the SL-lab,
  are documented.
